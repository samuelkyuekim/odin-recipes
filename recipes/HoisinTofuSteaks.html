  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Cook the rice</strong> - Combine the quinoa speckled rice, 1 cup (2 cups) water, and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until the grains are tender, about 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the hoisin sauce</strong> - Peel and mince or grate the garlic. Add the minced garlic to a small bowl along with the tamari, Chinese five spice, cashew butter, just 1 tbsp (2 tbsp) rice vinegar, just 2 tsp (4 tsp) agave, and 1 tbsp (2 tbsp) water. Whisk the hoisin sauce until smooth.    </li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the salad</strong> - In a medium bowl, combine the remaining rice vinegar, remaining agave, poppy seeds, and a pinch of salt and pepper. While whisking, drizzle in 2 tsp (4 tsp) vegetable oil. Peel and chop the clementine, removing any seeds, and add to the bowl.</li>
    <li><strong>Toast the almonds</strong> - Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat with the almonds. Cook, shaking the pan frequently, until fragrant and toasted, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the toasted almonds to a plate.</li>
    <li><strong>Crisp the tofu</strong> - Drain the tofu, pat dry, and cut into 8 steaks. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tbsp vegetable oil. Once the oil is hot, add the tofu steaks and sprinkle with salt. Cook until lightly browned and crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer the tofu steaks to a plate and drizzle with the hoisin sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve</strong> - Add the toasted almonds and spinach to the bowl with the dressing. Toss the spinach poppy seed salad to combine and divide between large plates. Top with the quinoa speckled rice and hoisin tofu steaks. Dig in!</li>
