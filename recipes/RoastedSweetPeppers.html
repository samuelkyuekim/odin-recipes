  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Cook the brown rice</strong> - Preheat the oven to 450°F. Heat 2 tsp olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and cook until translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add ras el hanout and a pinch of salt and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add brown basmati rice, 1½ cups water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until the grains are tender and water is absorbed, 30 to 35 minutes. (4-serving meal: use 4 tsp olive oil, 3 cups water)</li>
    <li><strong>Toast the almonds and cook the French lentils</strong> - Add almonds to a small saucepan over medium heat. Toast, tossing frequently, until lightly browned and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer toasted almonds to a medium bowl. Return the saucepan to the stove and add lentils, 2 cups water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until lentils are tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Drain any remaining water. (4-serving meal: use 4 cups water) TIP: To “sort” means to look for and discard any naturally occurring debris or stones.</li>
    <li><strong>Roast the peppers</strong> - Add mini sweet peppers, 2 tsp olive oil, and a pinch of salt to a baking sheet, and toss. Roast until peppers are soft and the skin starts to blister, 8 to 10 minutes. (4-serving meal: use 4 tsp olive oil)</li>
    <li><strong>Make the salsa</strong> - Add parsley, mint, cilantro, lemon zest, lemon juice, and garlic to the bowl with the almonds. Add 2 tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt and stir the toasted almond salsa. (4-serving meal: use 4 tbsp olive oil)</li>
    <li><strong>Serve</strong> - Fluff the cooked rice with a fork, add currants, and stir. Divide the rice and French lentils between bowls. Top with roasted sweet peppers and toasted almond salsa. Dollop with yogurt. Enjoy! </li>
